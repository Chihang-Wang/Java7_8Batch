    /*
     * 1:
     * The basic difference between final,
     * finally and finalize is that the final is an access modifier,
     * finally is the block in Exception Handling and finalize is the method of object class.
     *
     * 2:
     * The throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.
     * It can throw only one exception at a time.
     * The throws keyword can be used to declare multiple exceptions, separated by a comma.
     *
     * 3:
     * checked and unchecked.
     *
     * 4:
     * In Java,
     * an error is a subclass of Throwable that tells that something serious problem is existing
     * and a reasonable Java application should not try to catch that error.
     *
     * 5:
     * true.
     *
     * 6:
     * yes.
     *
     * 7:
     * try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File("test.txt"))) {
     * writer.println("Hello World");
     * }
     *
     * 8:
     * It will be garbage collection.
     *
     * 9:
     * Yes.
     *
     * 10:
     * Linkedlist has O(n) access and O(1) insert and delete performance.
     * ArrayList has O(1) access and O(n) insert and delete performance.
     *
     * 11:
     * Hashtable is synchronized compared to hashmap.
     *
     * 12:
     * It allows a method or field to be public static.
     *
     * 13:
     * In a Java class, a static block is a set of instructions that is run only once when a class is loaded into memory.
     *
     * 14:
     * default:
     * Adding a default method, or changing a method from abstract to default,
     * does not break compatibility with pre-existing binaries,
     * but may cause an IncompatibleClassChangeError if a pre-existing binary attempts to invoke the method.
     *
     * break:
     * Getting out of the loop.
     *
     * continue:
     * Getting out of the current loop.
     *
     * synchronized:
     * It allows only one thread to access.
     *
     * strictfp:
     * strictfp is used to ensure that floating points operations give the same result on any platform.
     *
     * transient: transient is a Java keyword which marks a member variable not to be serialized when it is persisted to streams of bytes.
     *
     * volatile: The Java volatile keyword is intended to address variable visibility problems.
     * By declaring the counter variable volatile all writes to the counter variable will be written back to main memory immediately.
     *
     * instanceOf:
     * Java instanceof is a keyword. It is a binary operator used to test if an object (instance) is a subtype of a given Type.
