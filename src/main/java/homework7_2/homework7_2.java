    * view vs stored procedure:
    *   A view represents a virtual table. You can join multiple tables in a view and use the view to present the data as if the data were coming from a single table.

        A stored procedure uses parameters to do a function... whether it is updating and inserting data, or returning single values or data sets.
    *
    * view vs materialized view:
    *   Views are generally used when data is to be accessed infrequently and data in table get updated on frequent basis.
    *   On other hand Materialized Views are used when data is to be accessed frequently and data in table not get updated on frequent basis.
